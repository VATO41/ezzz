    <h4><strong>about</strong></h4>
    <h6>Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly. <br>Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design. <br>Designers are toolmakers.
<br>Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator. <br>Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.
<br>Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</h6>
